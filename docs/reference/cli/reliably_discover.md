## reliably discover

Check for Reliably Suggestions

### Synopsis

Check your manifests for Reliably Suggestions.

Manifest(s) can be provided in several ways:
- read from standard input, with dash '-' as argument
- path to a single manifest file
- path to a folder that will be scanned recursively for manifests files

By default, the discover command, run without arguments, is scanning
manifests file from the current working directory.

```
reliably discover [path] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Discover with a single file:
$ reliably discover manifest.yaml

# Discover with a folder:
$ reliably discover
$ reliably discover .
$ reliably discover ./manifests

# Discover with reading manifest from stdin:
$ cat manifest.yaml |Â reliably discover -

# Discover with custom format & output to local file
$ reliably discover --format json --output report.json
```

### Options

```
  -f, --format string   Specify the output format: [simple json yaml sarif codeclimate]
  -h, --help            help for discover
  -o, --output string   Write results to a file instead of standard output
```
