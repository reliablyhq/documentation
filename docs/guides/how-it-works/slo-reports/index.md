# How Reliably CLI works

## SLO Report

### About Service Level Objectives

Service Level Objectives identify what you should care about on your system.
 They are what good looks like for the users of your system. If an SLO is underperforming, it will be impacting your users in some way.

### What does the SLO Report Command do

When the Reliably `slo report` command is entered the `cli` will go through the following steps:

* It will parse filters from the `-l` selector flag as well as the `-m` flags's manifest path if provided.

* If using the manifest for filtering, your report will only show objectives defined in your manifest.

* The CLI will request the objectives and objective results data from Reliably's API for your organization.

* Finaly the `cli` will write out the report in the desired format either to standard out or to a local file.

<!-- ### Time Window

When you define your SLI, you specify an Observation window that you want to measure the service over. The choices for the observation window are:

* 1 hour
* 1 day
* 1 week
* 1 month
* custom

When you select a custom observation window, you specify a custom period using
 the ISO-8601 period format.  Example ISO-8601 formats are:

| ISO8601 format | Human readable duration         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| PT1H           | 1 hour                          |
| P1D            | 1 day                           |
| P13DT3H27M     | 13 days, 3 hours and 27 minutes |

More details on [the Wikipedia page about ISO-8601 durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations)

:::note Note
The period of the observation window supports precision to 1 minute.

The period of the observation window must be less than 1 year.

### Availability SLO

An Availability SLO allows you to specify a target availability percentage for a Service. That target percentage is the percentage of the time that the service should be available.

#### Measuring Avaialibilty SLOs

The Reliably CLI allows you to measure you SLO targets. For availability, Reliably will calculate the percentage of error responses in
 the time window. All 5xx status responses are counted as errors.

### Latency SLO

A Latency SLO allows you to specify a threshold latency for a service and a target percentage. The percentage gives the target percentage of responses within that threshold latency.

#### Measuring Latency SLOs

For latency Reliably will determine the percentage of responses under the threshold specified for the SLO.

#### Where does the Reliably CLI get the Data from

The Reliably CLI receives Objective Results from the API to generate the report. These Objective Results are generated by Reliably's API when it receives Indicators. For AWS the CLI uses the Cloudwatch API to agregate data based on the defined time window. For GCP the CLI will query the GCP Monitoring API. You may also push Indicators directly to the API, which gives you the flexibility to define your own based on any metric.

### Reliability Report

For all the Objectives received, Reliably will construct a report showing if the target for the Objective is met or not. You can specify different output formats for the [SLO report]. The default table output for a manifest would be:

### Custom Reports

The Reliably CLI supports custom reports from templates, so you can generate your own report formats. This section explains how to use [Reports from Templates]
