# Login to Reliably

To use Reliably, you will need to authenticate the Reliably CLI
with [Reliably.com](https://reliably.com/).

:::tip Tip
  You can authenticate with third party OAuth providers. Reliably
  currently supports GitHub and GitLab.

  Reliably requires only access to the minimal set of information to create
  your profile. Usually your username and email address.
:::

## Login

You can login with the `reliably auth login` command, when prompted for the
type of login select a provider, with the arrow keys and select enter:

```console
$ reliably auth login
Logging into reliably.com
? How would you like to authenticate?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Login with GitHub
  Login with GitLab
  Paste an authentication token
```

An authentication page will be launched in your browser, for instance with
the GitHub provider:

![GitHub Login](./images/github_login.png)

When you accept the challenge, the browser will show a message to close its
window and the CLI will acknowledge you are now logged in.

```console
✓ Logged in as user
```

You have successfully logged in to Reliably and are now ready to use the
`reliably` commands.

## Check your authentication status

You can check your authentication status with the `reliably auth status` command:

```console
$ reliably auth status
reliably.com
  ✓ Logged in to reliably.com as user (~/.config/reliably/config.yaml)
  ✓ Token: *******************
```

## Retrieve your access token

You can retrieve your access token (aka API key) with the `reliably auth status --show-token` command:

```console
$ reliably auth status --show-token
reliably.com
  ✓ Logged in to reliably.com as user (~/.config/reliably/config.yaml)
  ✓ Token: 6ccfdxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Logout

You can logout with the `reliably auth logout` command:

```console
$ reliably auth logout
? Are you sure you want to log out of reliably.dev account 'user'? Yes
Logged out of reliably.com account 'user'
```

Your client session is now logged out from Reliably and you can no further
pass commands to Reliably.
