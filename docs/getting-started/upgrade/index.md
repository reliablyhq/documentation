## How to update

The CLI has the ability to download and replace its own binary.
To do so, simply run:


<CopyToClipboard />

```console
reliably update
```

<CopyToClipboard />

And follow the instructions on the screen.

You can then check your installed version with the `reliably --version` command.

## Update to a specific version

By default, the CLI updates to the latest version. This can be configured
by using the `--version` flag to choose a specific version to update to.

This version may also be a version older than the one that is
currently installed, thus allowing you to downgrade.

```console
reliably update --version 1.2.3
```
